1. HW # 4 parallelized using MPI code in a given Matrix Multiplication and you like to measure performance

2. HW # 4 for a given K-means algorithm code using the MPI in parallelism to Determine the performance


 Qn. 1, 2: all write the source code and reports, must be submitted

 Qn. 1, 2: the number of MPI processes per node use 1,2,4,8,16 (thorq --slots), changing the number of nodes (thorq -nodes) 1,2,4 measure performance and report

 issue size, but you can modify as you wish during the experiment, Qn1: 8192 X 8192 Matrix Multiplication
Qn2: 262,144 datapoint, 64 of centroid, 1024 single iteration

 When using make run in the directory, set 4 nodes and 16 MPI processes per node using thor enqueue in the Makefile

 Unlike the existing problems, using MPI requires modifications to be made to the skeleton code (initialization of data and timing code)
State the changes made in the report
